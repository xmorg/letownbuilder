TODOS: 


Weather
 DONE: Snow - create ice flakes falling down, requires at least 1 fire per 5 villagers to avoid freezing.[DONE]
 issue: create weather for snow and desert levels.
 * Snow - create snow on the ground, tiles get whiter...
 * Rain - causes  1/100th chance of causing flooding, 1/50th chance of putting out fires.
 * Rain - Flood trenches
 * Draught - lack of rain for 14+ days, causes a loss in plant life.  Green areas become dirt. Dirt does not regenerate until it rains. Drought has a 1/50 chance of ending.
 * Locusts! - all of your food are belong to us!  Locust has a 1/1000 chance of happening, and each green tile has a 9 /10 chance of being eaten.  All gardens reset to 0. Barns are untouched.  Any food not in a barn is eaten.
  
Bandit Raids - TBD
  * 1/500th chance of a bandit raid per day.
  * Bandits appear and steal between 75-95% of food.  
  * Resistance can cut the theft of food down to 25%, but risks loosing villagers. Between 0-half of villagers can die.  Sherriff and militia house can increase the chances of lower casualties.
  * Bandits can take other plunder like gold and captives.  Loosing villagers to captivity cause a massive drop in morale, and may cause loved ones to leave settlement to go look for them.
  * Bandit villagers may join in the looting. (25% chance)

Slaver Raids - TBD
  * Slavers appear and take 80% of population under the age of 45.
  * Resistance can be formed similar to bandit resistance.
  * Huge drop in morale.
